            For the first few tutorials we covered the basics of HTML and CSS when building websites. I am new to coding, specifically in the context of developing websites therefore made an effort to properly exercise the content we are learning. I previously took a course in creative coding which used JavaScript and fell very far behind making it quite a difficult course for myself. Therefore, did not want a repeat and was very conscious of trying to stay on top of what we were learning.

        For this exercise we were required to find a website and emulate it ourselves. I chose to emulate the basics of the website Sharesies. Overall, I really enjoyed this exercise and while initially daunting, I am happy with the result. It was satisfying to have a final website at the end and forced me to add elements in ways that may have not been the most efficient but gave me a better understanding of the languages and basics of creating a website. For me the most difficult aspects were positioning all of the separate elements on the page.

        We have started using GitHub for our projects so we can share our progress. GitHub is an especially useful resource when collaborating in groups over one project. The system distributes code through branches, having a central repository which then requires users to pull this code into their own repository before committing any final changes to the central repository. This is useful for a group of designers as you can easily track any changes you make and look back at previous commits to the repository.

        We have been introduced to the process of developing our blogs which requires us to create a wireframe. I have never wireframed before, so this is also new territory. I initially was unsure of how much detail to include and have since learned the difference between a block frame, wireframe and prototype. The block frame being an overview of the layout, the wireframe demonstrating the functionality, using minimal colour and the prototype expressing the full functionality and look of the final website. My wireframes are not exactly what a wireframe should be and I will most likely revisit them in the future. I believe while they are not perfect wireframes still provided a vital step in developing the blog and made it much simpler to visualize and then code.

        The most difficult aspect of the micro-assignment was positioning so it was very useful to go over the basics of this. In tutorial 5 we were required to then complete an assignment which uses flexbox. I struggled with this quite a lot however luckily, I had people around me to help therefore I got there in the end. Generally, I would get the boxes to move into the general area, however it was the refinement from the position and getting the further details when I struggled the most.

        As part of a process of learning to wireframe, we were required to learn to use Figma. I really enjoyed using Figma to wireframe and found it had simple tools that were easy to navigate as a beginner but could be pushed further once I gathered a better understanding of the program. When designing my blog I decided on purple and yellow being complementary colours and colours I liked. I also included my layout of the homepage which included and Nav bar at the top to be able to go to and from the home and reflection page. I decided to include images of my artwork as I wanted to include images to introduce myself but don’t have any photos that would suit this element. As well as this I included an about me section which included a brief description of myself.

Even though I have looked at user stories I’m not sure how specific to be however will continue to work on this as I move through the assignment. As a big part of this assignment is wireframing we went over more wireframing. I am starting to feel more comfortable with figma however in terms of the principles of designing a website I still feel not entirely confident which is probably expected. I am deciding between what brief to choose from. While I currently can wrap my head around a plane booking system much more than the course selection, I feel there is more room to experiment in the university brief.

I got to a point where there was not a lot of time left for how much work I had to do so had to get a kickstart. This also was to receive feedback in time before the due date so feel I have made good progress in the past few days. The feedback I received suggested shorter and more concise sentences to describe the interactivity, add annotations and more breathing room between text and elements. Overall this was very helpful information and I am glad I got enough done in time to receive feedback.

For Tuesday’s class we each pitched ideas for a website and had our first online meeting  as a group. I came up with the idea to have an interactive house plant care website named The Greenhouse. As someone who has a collection of indoor plants I thought this was a fun idea with the ability to use bright images and a clean look. My group ended up deciding on my idea which was exciting and I am really looking forward to developing it further.

So far I can see us working well as a group and have been very decisive which is important in a group project. We did not manage to receive any feedback but have planned to try have user stories and user flow diagram complete by next week.

        Since last week we met up on Monday in person, and completed the user stories and user flow diagram. Up until now I was slightly confused as to what this was, therefore being in a group has been helpful in this aspect as I am able to quickly learn what the tasks are we are required to do. The workload has been split evenly between the 5 of us as we all work in specific time slots, each working consistently in this time and all completing tasks. We were previously working on Miro but have since switched to Figma as recommended to us as we can keep it all in one place and easily share it which has made things easier.

        In this tutorial we went over the difference between block framing, wireframing and prototyping. Even though I have completed wireframing before in the previous assignments only now do I feel I properly can identify the differences, previously I had intended to do wireframes but probably could have identified the functionality of the website better, which is what I now understand is the main purpose of a wireframe. As well as this, we covered style guides which was another new concept to me. The style guide I can see being very useful, especially in a group so we can all be on the same page when making changes to our project.

        As a group we made an effort to finish our block frames in class, the process we took to make it a split workload was to create 3 sets of block frames, each person creating a different page on each one. This not only ensured a variety of options to select from, it also created a split workload and meant we all contributed the same amount. By the end of this class we had finished our block frames by selecting our favourite elements from each. Overall we feel we are on track and work well together as a group.

We did not manage to completely finish the wireframe so will have a discord meeting in our own time to finish so we can start our prototype next time. In saying that we are fairly close and are happy with the overall tone of the website which has the clean, natural and green energy we want it to convey.

The past week we have been refining our prototypes, adding details and improving based on the feedback from Josh and Blaine. I myself made some refinements to the Plant Introduction page and the difficulty key on the Plant Index.
